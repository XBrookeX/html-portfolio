<h1>The Best Movies According to Brooke</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies/Shows of All-Time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>How To Train Your Dragon 2</h3>
<p>Without a doubt, the best animated movie of all time. The story and animation is top tier.</p>
<h3>Avatar</h3>
<p>The best movie of all time. The visual effects and acting skills can't be beaten.</p>
<h3>Naruto</h3>
<p>Arguably, the best OG anime of all time. Not too long like one piece but more original than Dragon Ball. Truly the best of the Big 3.</p>
